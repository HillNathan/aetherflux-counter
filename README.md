# AetherFlux Reservoir Control Panel

## What is it?

This is a "control panel" for the Magic the Gathering Card AetherFlux Reservoir. It helps to track the seemingly straightforward but sometimes downright confusing math that comes with playing this card in combo decks. For those who may not be familiar with the card, this is it:

The text on the card reads as follows:

    Whenever you cast a spell, you gain 1 life for each spell youâ€™ve cast this turn.

    Pay 50 life: Aetherflux Reservoir deals 50 damage to any target.

It seems pretty simple. Cast one spell, gain one life; cast a second, gain two. These interactions are not what this app was built for. This app was for the people that go ham and cast twenty or thirty spells in a single turn and fire off the second ability multiple times in that same turn. Keeping track of how many spells you cast, what your life total is, can become complicated and time-consuming, and this app will let you be accurate and spend more time dabbing on your opponants!
